I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I am majoring in Computer Science on the machine learning track and minoring in statistics. Machine learning and statistics involve a lot of data processing and analyzing so this course will be relevant in building the foundation to more advanced concepts in the future. I am also interested in taking this course because data processing is very important in real-world applications such as training a machine learning model to do a certain task bylearning based on the data it analyzes.
